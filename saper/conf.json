    "ABOUT_PROGRAM": "Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden \"mines\" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. ... If a square containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game.",
    "HELP_TEXT":"The rule of the game is simple, the number on a block shows the number of mines adjacent to it and you have to flag all the mines. Some terms: Flag: Put a flag in a zone when you have confirmed that there is a mine. Question Mark: Put a question mark when you suspect that there is a mine."
